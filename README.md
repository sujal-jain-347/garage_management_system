# garage_management_system

The Garage Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to
streamline and automate the management of automotive service centers or garages.
Developed as part of a college project, this web-based application leverages Java
technologies, including Servlets, JSP, HTML, and filters, to provide a user-friendly
interface for administrators and workers.

Key functionalities of the system include authentication mechanisms to ensure
secure access, worker management capabilities for administrators to add, update,
and delete worker details, and vehicle management functionalities for managing
vehicle information, including make, model, and maintenance history.
Through the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
and role-based access control (RBAC), the system provides administrators with
full control over garage operations while limiting the access of workers to specific
tasks
